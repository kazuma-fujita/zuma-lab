## What's ZUMA Lab

I'm ZUMA, who usually develops web and mobile apps.

This blog was created in 2021 with the intention of studying Next.js and TypeScript.

Hosted on Vercel.

The design is made up of Material-UI.

For the time being, I would like to make it a place to disseminate the technical knowledge gained through personal development.
